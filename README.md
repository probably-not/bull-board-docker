# bull-board-docker

A small wrapper for bull-board to put into a running docker container and allow running in a cluster easily.

I'm by no means a frontend developer (anything that compiles to JavaScript is frontend, fight me), so I just followed [this tutorial from DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/setting-up-a-node-project-with-typescript) to set up the project.
